# Example environment variables for local development
# Copy this file to `.env` and adjust values before running the server.

# Server
PORT=3000

# Database - choose DB_TYPE 'mysql' or 'postgres'
DB_TYPE=mysql
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=appuser
DB_PASSWORD=s3cret
DB_NAME=dermatologico

# If you prefer to use a single DATABASE_URL (e.g., Render production), comment the individual vars above
# DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@host:5432/dermatologico

# Safety: to temporarily override the resolved DB settings with explicit local values,
# enable both of the following and set LOCAL_DB_* vars.
# This is intentionally gated by two flags to avoid accidentally connecting deployed services
# to developer machines.
# DB_USE_LOCAL=true
# ALLOW_LOCAL_DB=true
# LOCAL_DB_TYPE=mysql
# LOCAL_DB_HOST=localhost
# LOCAL_DB_PORT=3306
# LOCAL_DB_USER=appuser
# LOCAL_DB_PASSWORD=s3cret
# LOCAL_DB_NAME=dermatologico
